# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes using Machine Learning based on medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained using the PIMA Diabetes Dataset to classify diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
