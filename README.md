# ML-diabetes_prediction
This project predicts diabetes using Machine Learning based on medical parameters like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained on the PIMA Diabetes Dataset to classify diabetic and non-diabetic cases, demonstrating ML application in healthcare for early detection and decision support.
